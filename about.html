            <!--about JASON GREIG text-->
            <div class="text">
                <p>Jason Greig is a Lyttelton-based New Zealand artist and preeminent printmaker. He graduated from the University of Canterbury School of Fine Arts in 1985 with Honours in Engraving and went on to teach at the University of Otago and University of Canterbury.<br><br>
 
Greig works in monotype, etching, lithography, drawings and paintings. Greig is influenced by pre-expressionist artists, medieval and gothic art and also finds inspiration in works by Edgar Allan, H.P. Lovecraft and metal rock bands like Black Sabbath. His powerful images have been described as gothic, sombre and macabre. Haunting figures hold their own against bold backgrounds to create an overall ominous presence that is concurrently poetic and alluring to the viewer.<br><br>
 
Greig's works are held in numerous private and public collections including the National Art Gallery of New Zealand, Wellington, the Hocken Library in Dunedin, the Christchurch Art Gallery and the Aigantighe Art Gallery Timaru.
In 2006 the Christchurch Art Gallery hosted a survey of Greig's work, The Devil Made Me Do It. In 2010 Greig was among eight artists representing New Zealand at the Sydney Bienniale. In 2017 his work featured in two major exhibitions, The Dark Arts at Wellington City Gallery, and Your Hotel Brain at Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetū. <br> <br>
 
Greig is represented by Ivan Anthony in Auckland NZ, Hamish McKay Gallery in Wellington NZ, Brett McDowell in Dunedin, NZ and Darren Knight Gallery in Sydney, Australia.</p>
